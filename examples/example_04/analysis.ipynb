    "- **How can I tune the initial guess temperature?**  \n",

    "  \n",
    "- **How can I tune the width of the temperature range?**  \n",
    "  The width of the temperature scan range can be tuned using the keyword `dtemp` in the `md` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What if the system undergoes a solid-solid phase transition before melting?**  \n",
    "  The lattice that calphy automatically chooses for the solid is the **ground state**. For some elements, for example Ti, a solid-solid phase transition occurs before melting. HCP Ti transforms to BCC Ti and then to liquid. Therefore to use the automated method, the solid lattice has to be specified using the `lattice` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How can I calculate melting temperature at non zero pressure?**  \n",
    "  The required pressure can be specified using the `pressure` keyword. Note that specifying `tguess` could help speed up the calculation.\n",
